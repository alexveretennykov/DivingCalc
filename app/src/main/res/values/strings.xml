        <![CDATA[<b>Surface Air Consumption</b> is an expression of your air consumption
        during the dive at sea (surface) level. As we all know, air consumption increases with depth
        because pressure increases, which reduces the volume of the gas, increasing the density of
        the air we breathe (as per Boyleâ€™s Law).

        <br><br><b>Why is it important to know your SAC?</b>
        <br>The two things that determine our bottom time are the breathing gas used and the No
        Decompression Limits (NDL). So you will surely need to know how much breathing gas you
        will need for a dive and that is why you need to calculate your SAC rate. Knowing the average
        depth of the dive (AVG) and the SAC, we can calculate the minimum gas that we are going to need,
        from there we can choose the volume of our tank and/or modify the dive plan.

        <br><br><b>What Is A Good SAC Rate?</b>
        <br>There is no such thing as a good or bad SAC rate as this will differ between diver to diver.
        On average a new diver may equate a 25 or 27 litres per minute but a relaxed and experienced
        diver may equate 15 to 18 litres per minute.

        <br><br><b>What Affects SAC Rate?</b>
        <br>-Stress
        <br>-Exertion
        <br>-Physical shape
        <br>-Buoyancy
        <br>-Breathing
        <br>-Coldness

        <br><br><b>How Can I Decrease My SAC Rate?</b>
        <br>Dive more to get more experience, better buoyancy, reduce stress and exertion. Stay in
        good physical shape, which improves oxygen consumption and improves breathing. Wear a suitable
        suit, so as not to get cold throughout the dive.
